# ProtAccess

A Python tool that helps researchers access UniProt and NCBI databases using UniProt IDs only (Single ID or list of IDs stored in file). 

This tool helps obtain trascripts' nucleotide sequences and protien sequences (canonical or all isoforms) as well as gene ontology terms (listed or visualized in plot). 

Operates on Python 3.7.0 and runs in command line.
